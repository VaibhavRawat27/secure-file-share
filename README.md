## 📦 How It Works

1. 🎯 **Upload** any file using the interface.
2. 🔑 Set a password and expiry time (1 to 48 hours).
3. ☁️ File is uploaded to **Cloudinary** under your configured folder.
4. 🔗 A **secure link** is generated: `...?file=<unique_id>`
5. 🔒 The receiver must enter the correct password to **access/download**.
6. ⌛ The system automatically **denies access** after expiry.
7. 📱 A **QR Code** is generated for instant mobile scanning.

## 🧪 Test Mode / Notes

- App is in test mode — **monitor your Cloudinary usage** for bandwidth and storage.
- Files are uploaded as `resource_type="raw"` to allow **any file format**.
- Expiry is handled using timestamps stored in metadata (`context`) and checked during access.

---

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy

- No file or password is stored in any local database.
- All files are **automatically deleted** by denying access after expiry (timestamp).
- File download is protected by **password field** entered during upload.
- Shared links contain only the public Cloudinary ID and no sensitive data.

---

## 📚 Example Use Cases

- 🔐 Share confidential documents with clients
- 🎓 Share project files with time-bound access
- 📤 Temporary uploads for presentations or demos
- 📱 Easily scan QR and access from mobile
